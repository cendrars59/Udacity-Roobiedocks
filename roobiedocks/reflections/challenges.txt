My challenge is:

getting the level and skills of senior developper being able to develop on projects and being judged by one's peers as a valuable software craftsman.

Until now I have tried to learn coding langages C# or Java because I have given up because I didnâ€™t find a right track in order to progress and having motivating goals to achieve my aim.
